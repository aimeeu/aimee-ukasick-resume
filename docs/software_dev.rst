A Shuffle Down Memory Lane

I can remember playing text-based games on a Commodore 64 - can you?

The Early Years
---------------

Computer Science wasn't a subject I studied in college. Sure, I took Calculus and a class in BASIC, but women from my socio-economic background were expected to be teachers not engineers or scientists, if they went to college at all. So I graduated with a degree in History and a minor in Comparative Literature. Then I taught English as a Second Language for four years in Taiwan, returned to the US and earned a degree in Commercial Photography, decided I as too old to be treated like dirt by egotistic photographers, and opted to follow my older brother into the world of IT. Year 2000 (Y2K) remediation was ramping up, so companies such as Compuware were hiring people with an aptitude for programming and then training them in mainframe. I flunked the test Compuware gave prospective new hires. Fortunately, the Resource Manager encouraged me to take a Logic class and try again. I passed! Compuware sent me along with a group of about 20 new hires to Detroit for three months of mainframe programming training. Upon our return, we had to take another test, this one on COBOL and other mainframe languages. I flunked, so Compuware moved me to its Emerging Technologies group, where I learned Smalltalk and taught myself Java.

Compuware
+++++++++
The main project I worked on involved reading utility meters over the WAN and was funded by an external startup. The team had four developers doing C and C++, two tech writers, and 3-4 Java developers. The Java developers worked on software for field technicians, with a Java Swing UI. It was a great group of people, and I learned a lot. The biggest argument we developers had was where to put the curly braces in our code. We were on the bleeding edge - continuous integration, pair programming, and Agile complete with sticky notes stuck to a conference room wall. Ward Cunningham, Kent Beck, and Martin Fowler were worshipped at an almost unhealthy level. Lots of camaraderie, ribbing, and practical jokes. After a couple of years I found myself in a lead position on the project, mentoring new college hires. View the nitty gritty details in the :ref:`res-compuware` section of my resume. Sadly, all good things must come to an end. As the project funding was reduced, so was the staffing. I decided to move on to another consulting company where some friends worked.

Out of the frying pan and into the fire. My first assignment was working on an order and inventory system being written in C#. So I learned C# on the job and spent an inordinate amount of time clarifying requirements. Truthfully it was not an enjoyable :ref:`stint <res-centare>`. The next assignment was equally odious: working on a financial system for a hedge fund company located in a moldy office building. At least the office pranks were prime.

The Reach Out and Touch Someone Years
-------------------------------------
I had had enough of consulting and wanted a steady development job in a single location. By this time, my brother, Andy, was working for Ameritech, which had just been gobbled up by SBC. Andy secured me an interview with the hiring manager, who wanted an experienced developer to bring good software development practices to his group. I fit the bill. Years later, the hiring manager told me what sealed the deal was that when asked to explain Struts, I drew pictures on the whiteboard while explaining Model-View-Controller architecture in terms an old mainframer could understand.

For 12 years, I :ref:`facilitated bureaucracy <res-techgov>` as part of the Technology Governance group. My first assignment was not to  port code from ASP to Java but rather from ASP to VB.NET, so I learned another language on the job while leading a team of two junior developers and a DBA. The next assignment was also to port an app from ASP to VB.NET, despite my arguing for the app to be rewritten in Java and Struts. The ironic part was that the "approved" language for development within the company was Java, here was the Tech Governance group creating an app in a non-standard language... and the app was used by developers to request an exception to use a non-standard language or technology. Eventually we developers were able to convince management that our group's application really should be written in Java, so once again the porting began. The nice thing about working in the Tech Governance group was that it was small, so we wore many hats - requirements analyst, project manager, architect, developer, DBA, tester, tech writer, end-user support, server support, and whatever else the Executive Director wanted me to do. I learned Objective-C and iOS development in order to build a mobile app that would earn my boss some brownie points with his boss. The mobile app connected to a RESTful API back end, which pulled data from a database that contained information on all the home-grown apps in the company.
