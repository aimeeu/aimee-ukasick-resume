Software Development

I can remember playing text-based games on a Commodore 64 - can you?

The Early Years
===============

Computer Science wasn't a subject I studied in college. Sure, I took Calculus and a class in BASIC, but women from my socio-economic background were expected to be teachers not engineers or scientists, if they went to college at all. So I graduated with a degree in History and a minor in Comparative Literature. Then I taught English as a Second Language for four years in Taiwan, returned to the US and earned a degree in Commercial Photography, decided I as too old to be treated like dirt by egotistic photographers, and opted to follow my older brother into the world of computer programming. Y2K remediation was ramping up, so companies such as Compuware were hiring people with an aptitude for programming and training them in mainframe. I flunked the test Compuware gave prospective new hires. Fortunately, the Resource Manager encouraged me to take a Logic class and try again. I passed! Compuware sent me along with a group of about 20 new hires to Detroit for three months of mainframe programming training. Upon our return, we had to take another test, this one on COBOL and other mainframe languages. I flunked, so Compuware moved me to its Emerging Technologies group, where I learned Smalltalk and taught myself Java.

Compuware

The main project I worked on involved reading utility meters over the WAN and was funded by an external startup. The team had four developers doing C and C++, two tech writers, and 3-4 Java developers. The Java developers worked on software for field technicians.
